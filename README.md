Poultry Disease Classification Project 🐔💉

This project aims to develop an intelligent system for the automatic classification of poultry diseases using deep learning and computer vision. The goal is to help poultry farmers and veterinarians detect diseases early through image analysis of poultry waste or infected parts.


---

🔍 Objective

To predict poultry diseases from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), enabling early diagnosis and better treatment planning. This project includes:

Image preprocessing and data augmentation

Model training using CNN (TensorFlow/Keras)

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Web deployment using Flask

Simple and responsive UI for image upload and disease prediction



---

📦 Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask

VS Code for development

Git & GitHub for version control

Jupyter Notebooks for EDA & model experiments



---

✅ Key Features

Trained CNN for poultry disease classification

Works with common poultry diseases (Newcastle, Salmonella, Coccidiosis, etc.)

Image upload through Flask app

Class predictions displayed with high confidence

Extendable for more disease classes

Lightweight and deployable on local or cloud servers



---

📊 Metrics Tracked

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-score



---

🔁 Reproducibility

To retrain and run the model:

python model.py    # Train and save the CNN model
python app.py      # Run the Flask app


---

🌐 Web Interface

Upload an image of infected poultry waste/body part

Get the disease prediction instantly

Hosted on http://127.0.0.1:5000 locally



---

🧠 Future Work

Add real poultry image dataset from field farms

Integrate transfer learning (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet)

Expand model to detect early vs late stage infection

Deploy to cloud using Docker & Render/Heroku

Add multilingual support for farmers in rural areas
